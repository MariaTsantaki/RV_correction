RV correction
======

Correct for radial velocity shifts. 

It is run:

```python
python rv_correction.py fname.fits
```
The fits file has to be in a specific format. 

1) a text file (.dat or .txt) with 2 columns for the wavelength and flux.

2) a fits file (.fits) from the ESO archive (ESO SDP 1D spectrum) and also 1D files which include the key words 'CRVAL1' and 'CDELT1' in their header.

3) a table fits format (.spec). This is the format [FASMA](https://github.com/MariaTsantaki/FASMA-synthesis) saves the output synthetic spectra if requested.
