RV correction
======

Correct for radial velocity shifts. The solar spectrum is used as a template to calculate the cross correlation function. The code will read all spectra in the data folder.

It is run:

```python
python rv_correction.py 
```
The fits file has to be in a specific format:

a fits file (.fits) from the ESO archive (ESO SDP 1D spectrum) or also 1D files which include the key words 'CRVAL1' and 'CDELT1' in their header.

The output is saved in the: fname_rv.fits
